# ft_containers
This project aims to learn how C++ STL work by reimplementing some of the containers:

- Vector: sequence container that encapsulates dynamic size arrays.
- Stack: container adaptor that gives the programmer the functionality of a stack.
- Map: sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys. Implemented as red-black-tree
